Generic clocks are configurable clocks which run outside the system clock domain. They are often connected to peripherals which have an asynchronous component running independently of the bus clock, e.\-g. U\-S\-B controllers, low-\/power timers and R\-T\-Cs, etc.

Note that not all platforms have support for generic clocks; on such platforms, this A\-P\-I will not be available.
